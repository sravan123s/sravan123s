CREATING A MASTER AND SLAVE CONFIGURATION IN JENKINS?

A Jenkins master comes with the basic installation of Jenkins, and in this configuration, 
the master handles all the tasks for your build system.
If you are working on multiple projects you may run multiple jobs on each and every project. 
Some projects need to run on some particular nodes, and in this process, we need to configure 
slaves. Jenkins slaves connect to the Jenkins master using the Java Network Launch Protocol.
The Jenkins master acts to schedule the jobs and assign slaves and send builds to slaves to 
execute the jobs.
It will also monitor the slave state (offline or online) and getting back the build result 
responses from slaves and the display build results on the console output. The workload of 
building jobs is delegated to multiple Slaves.

HOW TO MANAGE PLUGINS IN JENKINS ?

Jenkins is such handy tool which can be easily extended via adding additional plugins in order 
to get more functionalities. E.g. including Git as SCM option etc. 
This can be easily done by selecting the option Manage Jenkins - Manage Plugins

HOW JENKINS CAN BE MOVED OR COPIED FROM ONE SERVER TO ANOTHER?
Copy all the files in your JENKINS_HOME directory over to the new server.
Point JENKINS_HOME on the new server at the new directory.
Copy the Jenkins war file over to the new machine and start it up.
All Jenkins settings, jobs, plugins, config, etc. live in JENKINS_HOME.

EXPLAIN HOW TO CREATE A BACKUP AND COPY FILES IN JENKINS?
You would require to copy and take backup of “JENKINS_HOME” directory in regular intervals.
You can create a cron job to do so.
Or you can use “Thin Backup” plugin in Jenkins.
All the configurations are stored as files in the Jenkins Home directory

HOW WILL YOU SECURE JENKINS?
1.Select Manage Jenkins, then Configure Global Security.
2.Click Enable Security. 
3.Select Jenkins' own user database.
4. Allow users to sign up.
5.Continue with Authorization, .

WHY DO YOU NEED A CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION OF DEVELOPMENT & TESTING?

WHAT IS MEANT BY CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION?
1.Developers check out code into their private workspaces.
2.When they are done with it they commit the changes to the shared repository (Version Control Repository).
3.The CI server monitors the repository and checks out changes when they occur.
4.The CI server then pulls these changes and builds the system and also runs unit and integration tests.
5.The CI server will now inform the team of the successful build.
6.If the build or tests fails, the CI server will alert the team.
7.The team will try to fix the issue at the earliest opportunity.
8.This process keeps on repeating.

HOW YOU ARE MANAGING THE HIGH AVAILABILITY IN JENKINS OR HAVE U CONFIGURED THE REPLICATION FOR JENKINS?
   no replication there will be only one master, we have our /var/lib/jenkins  under my LB i have my master 
   and standby master, 
   when customer hits my jenkins.com to my LB

HOW YOU ARE MANAGING JENKINS BUILDS
 shared library- we have a shared library once we write a code in shared library it get shared 

HOW TO CHANGE JENKINS PORT NO 8080 TO 80?
in jenkins we have a file called etc/sysconfig/jenkins in that file we have to change the port 8080 to 80

JENKINS FILES
Jenkins file is a text file which is used to store the jenkins pipeline defination and it is checked into the 
source control, all the stages and steps are involved in the declatative pipeline to instruct 
jenkins to which stage it should be exicuted

TYPES OF JENKINS PIPELINE
DECLARATIVE: Declarative pipeline has stages for every individual stage there are multipul steps in it
SCRIPTED: Scripted pipelinecode is a traditional way of working, In scripted there is no need of steps,

 To deploy artifacts to envernments we have to install publish over ssh plugin firts

SOME OF THE JENKINS PLUGINS
Maven integration==> It will give maven project
pipeneline utility steps==> used for the pipeline code
docker pipeline
role based authentication plugin==> to give roles to the users
